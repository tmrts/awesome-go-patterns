# Chain of responsibility

The [Chain of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern) pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain.

#implementation

An example showing implementation and usage can be found in [main.go](chain_of_responsibility/main.go).

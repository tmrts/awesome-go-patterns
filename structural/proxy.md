# Proxy Pattern

The [proxy pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern) provides an object that controls access to another object, intercepting all calls.

## Implementation

The proxy could interface to anything: a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or some other resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate.

```go
    // Some short examples
```

## Usage
For usage, see [observer/main.go](proxy/main.go) or [view in the Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/cr8jEmDmw0).
